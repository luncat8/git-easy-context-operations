## 0.1.0

First release.

### Added

- **Reword any commit message** - replace, append, or find-and-replace text in a
  commit that is not the tip. Descendant commits are replayed with identical
  trees, parents and author dates; the branch is updated with an atomic
  `update-ref`, and detached HEAD is supported when the commit is HEAD.
- **Fast-forward a branch onto a commit** - the default branch (detected from
  `origin/HEAD`, `main`, `master` or the current branch) or any branch you pick.
  The previous tip is parked on a backup branch (`old`, `old-2`, ...) *before* the
  move, discarded commits are reported, and a diverged branch needs a second
  confirmation.
- **Force push** - `--force-with-lease` by default (refused when the
  remote-tracking information is stale), `--force` as an explicit second command.
  Reports what the remote had and what it has now, and can push the old sha back.
- **Apply a patch at its proper base** - takes a commit, a range, the staged or
  working-tree changes, or a patch file; scores candidate bases (exact blob
  match > clean apply > 3-way merge > 3-way with conflicts) and applies the patch
  where it belongs: on a new branch, in a separate worktree, or on the current
  branch. Mailbox patches go through `git am -3` so the message is kept.
- **Branch operations** - **Create Branch...** (starts at the commit or branch the
  menu was opened on, with a name suggested from the commit subject),
  **Rename Branch...** (and, when the branch tracks a remote one, a choice: leave
  it alone, rename it on the remote too, or just push the new name),
  **Delete Branch...** (refuses the checked-out branch, refuses commits that exist
  nowhere else until you say "Delete anyway", and can delete the remote branch as
  well) and **Check Out Branch...**. Each is a single journal entry, so **Undo**
  restores the name, the tip, the tracking configuration and a deleted remote
  branch in one click - and a remote branch we pushed is only removed again while
  it still points at the sha we left behind (`--force-with-lease`).
- **Safety net** - hidden recovery refs under `refs/geco/`, backup branches, and
  a journal in `.git/geco/journal.json`. **Undo Last Operation** rolls operations
  back newest-first (refs, branches, worktrees, checked-out branch, remote
  branches).
- **"Git Easy Ops" view** in the Source Control sidebar with commits, branches and
  recovery points, each with a context menu; plus entries in `scm/title`,
  `scm/sourceControl`, `timeline/item/context` and the Command Palette.
- **Copy Commit SHA**, **Show Backups and Recovery Points**, **Why Don't I See the
  Menus?** helpers.
- 13 `geco.*` settings and an output channel that logs every operation with the
  git commands it ran.
- **Source Control Graph commit *and branch* menus** as a separate build: `npm run package:graph`
  produces `<name>-<version>+graph.vsix` with `enabledApiProposals` and the
  `scm/historyItem/context`, `scm/historyItemRef/context` and `scm/history/title`
  contributions - commit rows get reword / fast-forward / patch / create branch,
  ref (branch) rows get create / rename / check out / delete branch, fast-forward,
  backup and force push (VS Code still gates those menus behind the proposed API
  `contribSourceControlHistoryItemMenu`). **Git Easy Ops: Enable Source Control
  Graph Menu...** writes the required `"enable-proposed-api"` entry into VS Code's
  `argv.json` - comments and other settings preserved, backup alongside - and
  reports which half (build or runtime argument) is still missing.
- Stable per-commit menus without any flag: the "Git Easy Ops" view, Timeline
  commit rows (`timelineItem == git:file:commit`), `scm/title`,
  `scm/sourceControl`, `scm/repository` and the Command Palette.
- Test suite: 377 headless tests that build throw-away git repositories (including
  bare remotes and linked worktrees) and drive the interactive flows through a
  scripted fake UI, plus a VS Code integration smoke test.
